# React exercises

## Instructions

- [ ] Fork and clone the repo
- [ ] Run `npm install` from inside `react-exercises` folder to install dependencies
- [ ] Use `npm run dev -- --watch` to continuously run webpack build process in background
- [ ] Look inside App.js for components relating to each exercise
- [ ] Uncomment the exercise components one at a time and implement the solution
- [ ] Each exercise extends what was covered in the previous exercise. I would suggest you implement each of the exercises in its own folder provided. This will allow you to refer back to previous solutions in case you get stuck.
- [ ] Keep developer tools open to spot and errors as soon as they occur. It will make it easier to develop if you fix them as soon as they occur rather than let them build up.
- [ ] Commit and push after each exercise and create a pull request at the end.
